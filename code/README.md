###This directory contains instructions and sample code for various example projects developed around ZeroDriver

Every project uses a distinct peripheral for a better understanding of the board and its functionalities.

**Zerodriver_test** example demonstrates the use of RGB LED by standard blinky and the DRV8835 motor driver. It is recommended to start with this
project.

**Ultrasonic-bot** example utilizes an ultrasonic sensor and two DC motors. It is a good example of sensor based motor control.

**Laser-step-test** example illustrates the use of varying speed of DC motors to create varying patterns using a laser pointer.

**Stepper-iris** example demonstrates the interfacing of stepper motor with the ZeroDriver. To make things interesting, an ultrasonic sensor is
added to control the motor's movements.

**Load-control** example explains that the H-bridges are not only limited to motor control, but also in switching and controlling loads.

**MeArm-joystick** example demonstrates that the MeArm robotic arm can also be controlled using ZeroDriver.
