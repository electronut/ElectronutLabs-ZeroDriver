###This directory consists of instructions and sample code for the examples developed using ZeroDriver.

**ZeroDriver-init** demonstrates the use of RGB LED and DRV8835 motor driver.

**Ultrasonic-bot** is an example of controlling DC motors i.e. their speed and direction using an ultrasonic sensor.

**Laser-step-test** demonstrates the ability of DC motors to generate various patterns using a laser pointer.

**Load-control** demonstrates the capability of DRV8835 is not only limited to control motors, but also in controlling and switching loads connected to the terminal blocks.

**stepper-iris** example explains the interfacing of a bipolar stepper motor with ZeroDriver. To make things interesting, an ultrasonic sensor controls the stepper motor to drive a mechanical iris.

**MeArm-joystick** demonstrates that MeArm - a robotic arm, can be controlled manually using two joysticks interfaced with the ZeroDriver.
