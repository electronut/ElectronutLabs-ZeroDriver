## What is it?

**ZeroDriver** is an Arduino Zero-compatible dual-motor driver board for robotics and mechatronics projects.

Robotics projects usually need two boards - a microcontroller board and a separate driver for the motors. ZeroDriver combines both in one for your convenience.

## Features & Specifications

* Atmel SAM D21 ARM Cortex-M0+ 48 MHz chip with 256KB Flash and 32KB SRAM
* Texas Instruments DRV8835 Dual Low-Voltage H-Bridge IC
* RGB LED
* Color coded terminal blocks for easy connectivity
* Standard 10-pin JTAG header broken out
* SPI header broken out
* Reverse polarity protection for power supply
* 12 V max power supply, 1.5 A current per H bridge
* Shipped with Arduino Zero bootloader for easy programming

## What can you do with it?

Well, depends on your imagination. :-)

But we do have some awesome demo projects - complete with code and design
information. Take a look at the [code](code/README.md) directory.

## ZeroDriver Crowdfunding

We are currently trying to crowdfund the production of ZeroDriver at **Crowd Supply**.
